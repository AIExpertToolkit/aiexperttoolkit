    <h2>Analytics</h2>
    <p>We use Google Analytics 4 to understand aggregate usage. IP addresses are anonymized. We do not sell personal data.</p>

    <h2>Affiliate links</h2>
    <p>Some outbound links are affiliate links. They never change your price. We add UTM parameters for attribution and reporting.</p>

    <h2>Emails</h2>
    <p>If you email us, we’ll use your message only to respond. We don’t share your email with third parties.</p>
